# Refactor Code Horiseon Marketing Agency- Assistive Technology

## User Story
Hiring marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that their own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

##Project Goals and Objectives
Take the provided codebase and refactor it to make it accessible. Using the cardinal rule when working with someone else's code: "Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it".
